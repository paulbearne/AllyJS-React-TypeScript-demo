# Accessible Web Apps with React, TypeScript & Ally.js

Accessibility is an aspect of web development that is often overlooked. I would argue that it is as vital as overall performance and code reusability. We justify our endless pursuit of better performance and responsive design by citing the users, but ultimately these pursuits are done with the user’s device in mind, not the user themselves and their potential disabilities or restrictions.

**A responsive app should be one that delivers its content based on the needs of the user, not only their device.**

### One of the most common pain points regarding accessibility is dialog windows. 

There’re a lot of considerations to take in terms of communicating to the user about the dialog itself, ensuring ease of access to its content, and returning to the dialog’s trigger upon close.

A demo on the Ally.js website addresses this challenge which helped me port its logic to my current project which uses React and TypeScript. This project is a demo of an accessible dialog component using Ally.js within React with TypeScript.
