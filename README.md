# Accessible Web Apps with React, TypeScript & Ally.js

Accessibility is an aspect of web development that is often overlooked. I would argue that it is as vital as overall performance and code reusability. We justify our endless pursuit of better performance and responsive design by citing the users, but ultimately these pursuits are done with the user’s device in mind, not the user themselves and their potential disabilities or restrictions.

**A responsive app should be one that delivers its content based on the needs of the user, not only their device.**
